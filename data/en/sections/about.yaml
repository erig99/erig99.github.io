# a summary about you
summary: 'I am a passionate .NET Software Engineer with 5 years of hands-on experience in building scalable backend systems and web applications. I specialize in C#, ASP.NET, and Entity Framework, and Iâ€™ve worked on microservice-based systems integrated with various databases and cloud services. I enjoy solving real-world problems through clean architecture and robust code. Outside of work, I occasionally explore side projects, including Blazor-based and fullstack applications.'
